            "Truth be told? This album probably represented the very first funk by a contemporary artist I ever heard. Keep in mind it was when it came out. And at the time I had no idea what a musical genre (let alone funk) even was. The music of Cameo has always had a strong attraction to me ever since-likely due to that core musical memory. Historically for Cameo,this was an interesting time. Starting with 1984'sShe's Strange,Cameo pared down to a trio of three members in bandleader/founder Larry Blackson on lead vocals and bass with Nathan Leftenant and Tomi Jenkins as vocalists. Charlie Singleton left the band functionally to start a solo career. Yet the deepest thing about that was that Charlie,along with other members of the band,didn't leave completely. He,along with session musicians such as the Brecker brothers remained behind on this album which,as it were wound up being their iconic breakthrough album commercially-at least as far as pop char success was concerned.The title song and \"Candy\" are of course the signature mid 80's Cameo sound-stripped down funk sound,slap bass the texture of thick liquid. Another element that makes them stand out is the strong percussion breaks and Michael Brecker's sax solo on \"Candy\"-making for one of the strongest rhythmic patterns of mid 80's hard funk. \"Back And Forth\" is a straighter dance/funk groove that's highly catchy and melodic. It seems like a naked funk number,but the arrangement is filled with layers of dreamy synthesizers as well: a full sound creeping up from behind rather than immediately out front. \"She's Mind\" is the one slow jam here-really more mid tempo boogie with an appropriately jazzy pop sense of song craft showcasing what terrific songwriters Cameo were. \"She's Mine\",a drum beat oriented hip-hop/funk hybrid as well as the furious live band oriented funk of \"Fast,Fierce & Funny\" and \"You Can Have The World\" are all brightly composed and heavily rhythmic grooves-all focusing on the theme of materialistically demanding women that was a mainstay for Cameo throughout the years.Many \"jam fans\" who have an intense dislike for the music of the first half of the 1980's refer to the period in which this album came out as a rebirth of the funk. As soon as James Brown hit the airwaves with \"Living In America\",music that was strongly linked with classic funk began to be innovated on. That also found itself spreading into the next generation of hip-hop as well-especially as the functional original funk bands who didn't have the commercial success of Cameo abandoned the idea of radio play and musical commerce.  So the \"nu funk\" as it were,and the generation of hip-hop that both inspired it and was inspired by it was all part of the culture from which this album came. It would seem looking back that no one was particularly self conscious about this burst of funk creativity. It seemed to be a degree of life breathed into the \"number one funk\" aestetic of the 60's and 70's-where music that celebrated advanced rhythmic ideas and lyrical wit in a contemporary context could flourish. This album is one of the many that really captures that spirit. And reminds any cynic who thinks that funk is dead that,when it seems to be gone,it can survive and (in cases such as this) be enormously successful as well.\n"
